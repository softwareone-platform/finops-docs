# Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is an integral part of a cloud security and management strategy.  It's crucial for maintaining the integrity and performance of cloud services, as well as for identifying and addressing potential issues before they cause significant damage or disruption.

The Anomaly Detection feature in FinOps for Cloud helps you identify unusual behavior that may indicate a security breach, system malfunction, or other operational challenges.&#x20;

You can view information about all anomalies created under specified policies on the **Anomaly detection** page.&#x20;

On the **Anomaly detection** page, you can [create or add a new policy](create-anomaly-detection-policies.md) and [manage your existing policies](view-and-manage-policies.md). Additionally, you can:

* Search for a specific policy by its name or description.&#x20;
* Track the dynamics in the **Status** column and hover over it to see both the average and current values.
* Check the instances where the policy is applicable. An en dash (–) in the **Filters** column means the policy applies to all cases.
* View resources associated with the policy by selecting the **Show resources** icon in the **Actions** column.
