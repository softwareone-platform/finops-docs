# Quotas and Budgets

FinOps for Cloud lets you manage and optimize cloud costs. It aims to help you manage cloud resources effectively, ensuring cost optimization and compliance with budget constraints.

Setting budgets and quotas is a core feature that allows you to control cloud spending. Budgets in cloud storage refer to the financial limits an organization sets to manage the costs associated with cloud storage usage. Quotas limit the storage resources a user, application, or department can consume.

You can access **Quotas and Budgets** from the **Policies** section in the sidebar.

The **Name**, **Status**, **Description**, and **Filters** columns show information about your existing quotas or budgets. The type of budget can be easily detected by the description:
