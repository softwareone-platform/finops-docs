# Create Quota or Budget Policies

If you have the **Organization manager** role, you can create a new quota or budget policy using the **Add** option on the **Quota and Budgets** page.

To create a new policy:

1. On the **Quota and Budgets** page, select **Add**.
2. On the **Create Quota or Budget Policy** page, enter the name and select the type. Additional fields appear according to the selected type.
3. Enter data into these fields. If necessary, set the data source, pool, owner, and other filter options.
4. Select **Save**.

The new policy is created and displayed on the **Quotas and Budgets** page. Use the **Status** field to view the current resource count or expense value. The quota itself can be found in the **Description** field.

If this value exceeds the quota or budget, the progress bar turns red. In other cases, it turns green. The progress bar’s occupancy also shows how close the current value is to the set threshold values.
