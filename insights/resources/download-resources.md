# Download Resources

You can download a complete list of discovered cloud resources for analysis, reports, or integration with external tools.

The downloaded file includes metadata such as resource type, cost, usage, tags, ownership, and more.

### Downloading resources

To download a list of resources:

1. From the sidebar, navigate to the **Resources** page.
2. (Optional) Select the data range and apply filters as needed.
3. Select **Download**. The **Download** option appears above the table that lists all cloud resources. You might need to scroll down to see it.
4. Choose either **XLSX spreadsheet** or **JSON file** to start the download.

If the data is too large, the FinOps platform shows a message. To continue, modify the filters to reduce the amount of data, and then try downloading again.
