# Reapply Ruleset

The **Re-apply ruleset** option initiates a new check of the already assigned resources against the current ruleset.

When selected, this option reorganizes the resources, even if they were previously assigned otherwise. This feature helps you manage assignments, especially when the rules are edited, new ones are added, or the priority of existing rules is changed.

{% hint style="info" %}
The option to reapply a ruleset is only available to individuals with Organization Manager or Root Pool Manager permissions.
