The **Cost explorer** feature contains tools and options to help you analyze costs and understand the cost structure for your organization.&#x20;

Using this feature, you can view your total expenses for the selected period and compare them with the total expenses from the previous period. You can also view a chart of your expense data to understand your overall spending and identify any trends or changes in your spending patterns.

* **Date range** - Use this to adjust the date range. The date range selector offers flexibility in analyzing costs over different time frames.
* **See expenses breakdown by** - Allows you to explore and analyze the expense breakdown by **Source**, **Pool**, or **Owner**. When you select any of these options, a detailed pie chart and data summary are displayed.
