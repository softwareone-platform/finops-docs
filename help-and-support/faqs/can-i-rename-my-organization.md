# Can I rename my organization?

Your organization name in FinOps for Cloud is based on the name entered when the subscription was ordered through the SoftwareOne Marketplace.

If you want to rename your organization, you can do this from the **Settings** page in FinOps. Note that only **Organization managers** can update the name.
