<summary>How is FinOps for Cloud billed?</summary>

Note that the 4% fee might be waived depending on your agreement with SoftwareOne.

<summary>Will I still be charged for FinOps for Cloud if I have an Essentials agreement with SoftwareOne?</summary>

If you have an Essentials agreement with SoftwareOne, your fee is waived in accordance with your agreement.&#x20;

This means that if your subscription falls under the Essentials agreement, you won't incur any additional charges. You will still receive an invoice, but the applicable fees will appear as credited, resulting in a total balance of $0.&#x20;

However, if you have connected data sources that are not included in your Essentials agreement, you will incur charges.

<summary>Will I be charged if I disconnect a data source from FinOps for Cloud?</summary>

You’ll only be billed for the days your data source is connected. Once you disconnect the data source, billing will stop, and you will no longer receive invoices.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Disconnecting a data source results in the loss of any historical data associated with it.

<summary>Where can I view my invoices?</summary>

You can view your invoices on the **Invoices** page in the Marketplace Platform. The page is located under **Billing** in the main navigation menu. To learn more, see [Invoices](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/modules-and-features/billing/invoices).

<summary>My Azure CSP subscriptions have been transferred from another partner to SoftwareOne. Will I incur any charges for these subscriptions?</summary>

Once your subscriptions are transferred, they must be synced to an active Microsoft Azure agreement in the Marketplace.&#x20;

During this process, your entitlements are created automatically, and the associated fee is waived. Note that the subscriptions that are transferred must be part of an Essentials agreement for the fee to be waived.

<summary>My SoftwareOne Cloud Spend agreement is valid until December 2025. Can I still move to FinOps for Cloud?</summary>

Yes, you can switch to FinOps for Cloud even if your Cloud Spend agreement is valid until December 2025. However, your data won't be migrated from Cloud Spend to FinOps for Cloud.

If you want to switch, you must place an order for a FinOps for Cloud subscription from the Marketplace Platform. For details on how to place an order, see [Order FinOps for Cloud from Marketplace](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/extensions/finops-for-cloud/order-finops-for-cloud-from-marketplace).&#x20;

Once your order has been processed, you'll receive FinOps for Cloud at no additional charge until December 2025.

<summary>Why does the pricing in FinOps not match the SoftwareOne invoice?</summary>

SoftwareOne's FinOps for Cloud is designed to show your estimated costs for the current period, whereas billing management is only available when your SoftwareOne invoice has been issued.

There are a few reasons why the amounts in FinOps and your invoice will differ:

* All amounts displayed in FinOps for Cloud are estimates for the current period, so they won’t exactly match your invoice. These estimated amounts are provided so you can make informed decisions about budgeting and resource optimization proactively.
* Billing management presents data directly from your billing documents, such as invoices and statements. You can access this data only after these documents have been issued, and the amount will match exactly what is listed on your invoice.
* Your invoice is generated at the end of your monthly billing period, whereas FinOps data is updated daily, so you can proactively monitor expenses.
* Your FinOps account may show cost information from various cloud service providers, like Microsoft and AWS, whereas your invoice only contains subscriptions and items ordered through SoftwareOne Marketplace.

The following table summarizes these differences:

<table><thead><tr><th width="164">Component</th><th width="242">FinOps for Cloud</th><th width="249">SoftwareOne invoice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amount</td><td>Always shows the estimated amount for the current period.</td><td>Always shows the exact amount.</td></tr><tr><td>Subscriptions</td><td>Contains subscriptions from all connected cloud service providers.</td><td>Contains SoftwareOne subscriptions only.</td></tr><tr><td>Data availability</td><td>Available daily, even before the invoice has been issued.</td><td>Available monthly, only after the invoice is generated.</td></tr><tr><td>Other features</td><td>Offers enhanced features, like tagging policies and budgets.</td><td>Doesn't offer advanced analytics and monitoring.</td></tr></tbody></table>
