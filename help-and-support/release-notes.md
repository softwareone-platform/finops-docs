# Release Notes

## Release Date: 15 Sep 2025 <a href="#release-date-20-february-2025" id="release-date-20-february-2025"></a>

### Introducing Cost Map

We’re rolling out Cost Map, a new feature that provides a visual and interactive representation of cloud spend across regions and cloud providers.

The Cost Map includes two dedicated tabs:

* Expenses by Region – visualize spend geographically across cloud deployments
* Expenses Due to Network Traffic – analyze costs driven by data transfer and connectivity

Additionally, the Cost Explorer view now includes a new breakdown option: Geography, allowing users to analyze expenses by region.

### Reports Download

We’ve added download functionality to support offline analysis, reporting, and integration with external tools. Users can now export data from the following modules:

* Resources: Download Resources table as Excel or JSON, and Charts as PNG
* Cost Explorer: Download as PDF
* User Management: Download users as Excel or JSON

### New Filters in Resource View

We’ve introduced new filtering options in the Resources module to help users narrow down and analyze cloud assets more effectively.

You can now filter resources by:

* Multi-Select Fields – select multiple values across key dimensions for more flexible filtering
* First Seen Date – identify newly discovered resources
* Last Seen Date – track resources that may have been removed or are no longer active

### Improved Email Formatting

We’ve improved the formatting of monetary values in all email communications. Currency values are now consistently presented for better readability and reduced risk of misinterpretation—especially in automated alerts and summaries.
