### Cost Map for Cloud Spend Analysis

Cost map is a new feature that offers a visual and interactive representation of your cloud spend across regions and cloud providers. The **Cost map** page includes two tabs:

* **Region** - This tab allows you to visualize your spending geographically across cloud deployments.
* **Network traffic** - This tab allows you to analyze costs associated with data transfer and connectivity.

Additionally, the Cost Explorer view now includes a new breakdown option called **Geography**, allowing you to analyze expenses by region.

### New Download Functionality

A new download option has been introduced to facilitate offline analysis, reporting, and integration with external tools. You can now download data from the following modules in FinOps for Cloud:

* **Resources** - Download your resource data as an Excel spreadsheet or JSON file. You can also download Charts as PNG files.
* **Cost explorer** - Download the data as a PDF.&#x20;
* **User management** - Export your list of users as an Excel spreadsheet or JSON file.&#x20;

### New Filters in Resource View

New filtering options are added to the [Resources](../insights/resources/) page to help you narrow down and analyze cloud assets more effectively. You can now filter resources by:

* **Multi-select fields** - This allows you to select multiple values across key dimensions for more flexible filtering.
* **First seen date** - This allows you to identify newly discovered resources.
* **Last seen date** - This allows you to track resources that might have been removed or are inactive.

### Improved Email Formatting

We have enhanced the formatting of monetary values in all email communications.&#x20;

Currency values are now presented consistently for better readability and a reduced risk of misinterpretation, especially in automated alerts and summaries.
