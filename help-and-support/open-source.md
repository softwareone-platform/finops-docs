# Open Source

At SoftwareOne, we believe in the power of open source. Open source communities drive innovation, foster transparency, and accelerate progress through shared knowledge and collaborative development. This belief has shaped the foundation of our latest FinOps tool, [FinOps for Cloud](https://portal.finops.softwareone.com/), which is built on top of the open-source project [OptScale](https://github.com/hystax/optscale) developed by [Hystax](https://hystax.com/).

### Built on OptScale, Powered by Partnership

FinOps for Cloud represents a key step in SoftwareOneâ€™s commitment to delivering powerful, user-centric tools for cloud financial operations. By leveraging OptScale, an advanced open source platform for cloud cost management and optimization, we are able to accelerate value delivery to our customers while aligning with a growing and active open source ecosystem.

Our collaboration with Hystax has been instrumental in bringing this vision to life. We are deeply grateful for the open and cooperative relationship we enjoy with their team, and we recognize the high-quality foundation their work on OptScale provides. As part of this collaboration, SoftwareOne is proud to contribute back to the OptScale project and support its continued evolution.

### Our Approach to "FinOps for Cloud"

The initial release of FinOps for Cloud focuses on delivering core capabilities that empower organizations to gain visibility into cloud usage and manage costs effectively. While this version does not yet include the full suite of features available in OptScale, it has been designed with scalability and extensibility in mind.

As we continue to evolve our FinOps strategy and product roadmap, we are actively evaluating additional OptScale capabilities and assessing how best to bring them to our users. Our intent is to provide a balanced experience that meets enterprise needs while remaining tightly aligned with the open source project's development.

### Looking Ahead

SoftwareOne remains committed to fostering open source collaboration. Our work with [Hystax](https://hystax.com/) and the [OptScale](https://github.com/hystax/optscale) community is just the beginning. By contributing code, sharing feedback, and engaging with the broader community, we aim to support and extend the ecosystem that enables cost-efficient, cloud-native operations for organizations around the world.

We look forward to continuing this journey and invite our partners, customers, and the open source community to join us as we build the future of FinOps together.
