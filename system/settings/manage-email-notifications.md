# Manage Email Notifications

In FinOps for Cloud, you can customize your email notification settings to determine which notifications you want to receive to stay informed about important updates.&#x20;

The notifications are organized into various categories, including:

* **FinOps** - This includes weekly expense reports, pool limit alerts, and notifications for new saving opportunities.
* **Policy alerts** - This includes all policy-related alerts.
* **Recommendations** - This includes all savings and security recommendations.
* **System notifications** - This includes system status or operational messages.
* **Account management** - This includes notifications related to account invitations.

## Managing email notifications

To manage your email notifications:

1. Navigate to the **Settings** page, then select the **Email notifications** tab.
2. Select the arrow next to each category to expand it and view the individual notification types. A list of alerts appears, along with toggle switches to enable or disable them.
3. Use the toggle button to manage your preferences:
   * Purple (On) - You will receive email notifications.
   * Gray (Off) - You won't receive email notifications.

At the top of each category, a label shows how many alerts are active out of the total available (for example, **Active: 4/4**).&#x20;
