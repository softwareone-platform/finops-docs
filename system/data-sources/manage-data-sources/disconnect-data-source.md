# Disconnect Data Source

The **Disconnect** option on the details page of a data source lets you disconnect and remove a data source from FinOps for Cloud.&#x20;

When a data source has been disconnected, you’ll only be charged for the days the data source was connected. Once it’s disconnected, billing will stop, and you won’t receive any further invoices.&#x20;
