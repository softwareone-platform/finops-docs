# View and Manage Users

In FinOps for Cloud, the **User management** page shows a list of existing users in your organization and what role they have been assigned. Each page shows up to 50 users.&#x20;

For each user, you can also view the following information:

* The user's name and the unique ID assigned to them by FinOps for Cloud.
* The last time the user accessed the organization.
* The user's email address.

From this page, you can find a specific user using the **Search** option, invite new users, and remove users who no longer need access to your organization.&#x20;

### Inviting users to your organization

Organization Managers can invite a new user to the FinOps organization by selecting **Invite** on the **Users** **management** page. To learn more, see [Invite Users to Your Organization](../../finops-for-cloud/getting-started/invite-users-to-your-organization.md).

### Removing a user from your organization

1. Navigate to the **User management** page.
2. From the list of users, find the individual you want to remove.&#x20;
3. In the **Actions** column, select the delete icon.
4. In the **Delete user** panel, select the organization manager who will take over all the assets of the individual you want to remove. This step is mandatory.
