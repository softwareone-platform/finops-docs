# View and Manage Users

In FinOps for Cloud, the **User management** page shows a list of all users in your organization and what role they have been assigned. Each page shows up to 50 users.&#x20;

For each user, you can also view the following information:

* The user's name and the unique ID assigned to them by FinOps for Cloud.
* The last time the user accessed the organization.
* The user's email address.

From this page, you can find a specific user using the **Search** option and remove users who no longer need access to your organization.&#x20;
