# Invite Users to Your Organization

When setting up your FinOps organization, it's important to consider the different roles you need for your account members. The roles available within FinOps for Cloud include Organization Manager, Manager, Engineer, and Member. For a description of these roles, see [User Management](../../system/user-management.md).

We recommend assigning the Organization Manager role only to those individuals who require the highest level of access and permission to perform actions without any restrictions.

Once you have determined the appropriate roles for each individual you want to add to your account, navigate to **User management** to start adding new users.&#x20;

## Inviting users to your organization

To invite new members to your organization:

1. On the **User management** page, select **Invite**.
2. On the **Invite users** page, complete the following steps:
   1. **Email** - Enter the email addresses of the member you want to invite. You can enter multiple email addresses at once.
   2. **Add role** - Select **Add role** to assign a role to the members you want to invite. You must also select a pool for each member. All pools and sub-pools existing within your environment are displayed. Note that a member with **Manager** and **Engineer** roles can belong to several different pools.
3. Select **Invite**.

An invitation email will be sent to the individual. Once the invite has been sent, you can view the invitation status on the **Invitations** tab within the [Settings](../../system/settings.md) page.
