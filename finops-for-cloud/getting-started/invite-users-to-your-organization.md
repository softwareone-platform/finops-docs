# Invite Users to Your Organization

When setting up your FinOps organization, it's important to consider the different roles you need for your account members.&#x20;

The roles available within FinOps for Cloud include Organization Manager, Manager, Engineer, and Member. For a description of these roles, see [User Management](../../system/user-management/). Once you have determined the appropriate roles for each individual you want to add to your account, open **User management** to start adding new users.&#x20;

To invite new members to your organization:

1. From the left sidebar, select **User management**.
2. On the **User management** page, select **Invite**.
3. On the **Invite users** page, complete the following steps:
   1. **Email** - Enter the email addresses of the members you want to invite. You can enter multiple addresses.&#x20;
   2. **Add role** - Select **Add role** to choose a role. You must also select a pool for each member. All pools and sub-pools existing within your environment are displayed. Note that a member with **Manager** and **Engineer** roles can belong to several different pools.
4. Select **Invite**.

A confirmation message is displayed stating that the user has been invited, and an invitation email is sent to the individual.&#x20;
