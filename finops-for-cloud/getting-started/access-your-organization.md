# Access Your Organization

To use FinOps for Cloud, you need an account. This account is different from your Marketplace Platform account.&#x20;

When you order a [FinOps for Cloud subscription from the SoftwareOne Marketplace](https://docs.platform.softwareone.com/extensions/finops-for-cloud/order-finops-for-cloud-from-marketplace), we will process your order and create an organization for you. This organization represents your account.

FinOps for Cloud provides different experiences for first-time access, depending on whether you are an organization administrator or user.

### FinOps for Cloud Administrators

Once we process your order, the organization administrator will receive a password recovery email containing a verification code. This email will be sent to the address specified during the ordering process.

To set up a new password and sign in, the organization administrator must follow these steps:

1. Open the password recovery email from SoftwareOne FinOps for Cloud.
2. Select **Recover password**.&#x20;
